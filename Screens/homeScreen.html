        <p class="learn">Mathematics has a profound impact on cognitive development, influencing the way the human brain
            thinks and processes information. It fosters creativity and problem-solving abilities, enabling individuals
            to think critically and find innovative solutions to challenges. Consequently, we are dedicated to
            empowering children between the ages of 4 and 8 to develop age-appropriate mathematical skills and
            problem-solving capabilities.</p>
